We test what diffrent buttons and motions do to the watch state (NO Background services application) App Version Commit #:4d832d1 "mostly working version"


CONCLUSIONS:

	Without background services:
		- "Select" Button (top right) : Interaction with app (input)
		- "Screen Tap": Same input as "Select" Button
		
		- "Back" Button (bottom right): Does onHide() -> onStop()
		- "Swipe" (left to right): Does the same as "Back" Button
